# Clipboard to Notes
I created this simple Alfred workflow to add the clipboard content as a new note.

The workflow uses a global keyboard shortcut (CMD+Shift+C by default) to copy the highlighted text to the clipboard, and add it as a new note in a folder in Apple Notes. This makes it easy to save important information for later.
